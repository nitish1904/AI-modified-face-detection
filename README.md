# AI-modified-face-detection
This project is done using deep learning techniques such as AlexNet and custom architecture that detects the fake face generated by  AI. Dataset has 20000 fake faces generated by GAN and 20000 real faces. We have used Data Augmentation[regularization  technique] to populate the dataset to prevent overfitting.
